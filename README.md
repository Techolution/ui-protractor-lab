## Lab

Before doing this lab you need to run `npm install` after cloning this repo.

Start the application with `ng serve` in the command line and then open up the application at `http://localhost:4200/` and take a quick look at it. Open up the e2e spec files in e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts, e2e/app.home.po.ts.  Specs have been written in app.e2e-spec.ts but without actual implementations.  Add the implementations to them.  

Each time you run the e2e tests again you need to run: `npm e2e` in the command line.

If you want to see one set of possible solutions you can check out the solutions branch with: git checkout solutions.
